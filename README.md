I'm trying to make it so each row is in order with eachother. If you run index.html,
you'll see that all the first column is all in order, but they all get scattered as they go into the second column and so on. Except, for some reason 2 
rows in the second column are in line with eachother, and 2 different rows are inline in the last column. I don't know why this happened. Any help is appreciated,
I want to solve this as fast as I can.
